# ✅ Cypress End-to-End Testing - UI Automation Assignment

This project demonstrates automated end-to-end (E2E) testing using **Cypress**, a modern JavaScript-based testing framework. It replicates user behavior such as navigation, form interaction, and DOM validation to ensure the stability and functionality of a web application.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Perform UI automation testing using Cypress  
- Simulate real user interactions including navigation, typing, clicking, and form submission  
- Validate application behavior through assertions  
- Ensure content is rendered and functions as expected across test scenarios

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Cypress  
- Node.js and npm  
- Mocha and Chai (built into Cypress)  

---

## 📂 Project Structure

The Cypress test suite typically includes the following:

- End-to-end test files located in the `e2e` folder  
- Configuration settings managed in the `cypress.config.js` file  
- Optional custom commands and reusable functions in the `support` folder  
- Static test data in the `fixtures` folder if used  

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Install project dependencies using npm  
2. Launch Cypress using the test runner interface or via terminal  
3. Make sure the web application under test is running or deployed  
4. Execute test cases and view live test results through the Cypress runner
